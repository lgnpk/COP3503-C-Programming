General Usage Notes:
------------------------------------------------
- Make sure that casino.cpp and casino.h are located in
  the same directory

- In this program, the user will be able to play one of two card games:
  war or blackjack

- There is no undoing this function. Once selecting a game, you must play it
  through its entirety before playing another round and/or playing a different
  game.

Rules for Blackjack:
------------------------------------------------
1. Each player is dealt two cards, first you as the player as well as the house (the dealer)
2. You will be able to see both of your cards and only one of the house’s cards
3. The object of the game is to get your hand total to get as close as possible to 21 without going over, also known as “Busting.” If your hand adds up to 21, you automatically win and will receive a payout based on the stakes for that given night for the game of Blackjack.
4. Upon looking at your hand, you may decide if you would like to “Hit” or “Stick” by typing those works exactly when prompted (the input is case-sensitive).
5. If you decide to “Hit,” you will receive another card to your hand. At this time, if your hand total equals 21, you win. However, if your hand total is greater than 21, you “bust”, the game is over, and the house wins.
6. If your hand does not equal 21 at this time, you have the option to “Hit” again, which means you will receive another card, or to “Stick,” in which case your hand will not increase in value.
7. If you decide to “Stick”, you will not receive a new card to your hand, and the play turns over to the dealer to may “Hit” and/or “Stick” as well.
8. Once the dealer’s hand has been confirmed, then all cards are turned over, and the player with the higher overall hand total wins that round.

Rules for War:
-----------------------------------------------
1. The deck of 52 is split in half among you and your opponent.
2. The first two cards on the top of each hand are compared based on rank. Ace in this game is highest in value.
3. The comparison continues until the cards that are drawn are equal. Then you declare War and 4 cards are placed down.
The last card from each of the 4 is compared again and if they are equal the process repeats until they are different.
4. The winner gets all the cards from their own hand and from the hand of the opponent.
